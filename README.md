# MLA Complaint System

## Project Overview

The **MLA Complaint System** is an application designed to allow citizens to submit complaints related to various government departments and track their resolution status. The project aims to streamline the complaint submission process, improve communication between citizens and government departments, and provide transparency by displaying the status of complaints. The system is built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Supabase** for authentication and database management.

### Key Features:
- **Citizen Login/Signup**: Citizens can log in using Google authentication and view or update their profiles.
- **Complaint Submission**: Citizens can submit complaints regarding issues in their village, choosing the relevant department for the complaint.
- **Department Dashboard**: Government departments can view complaints, change their status (Pending, Working, Completed), and provide resolutions.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage user accounts, departments, and view all complaints in the system.
- **Complaint Status Tracking**: Citizens can track the status of their complaints and view resolutions provided by the relevant departments.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Authentication, Database, Storage)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend), Supabase (Backend)

## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A **GitHub** account to contribute

### Setting Up the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mla-complaint.git

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
